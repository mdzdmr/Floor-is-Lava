# Mine Escape

## Introduction

"Mine Escape" is an adventure simulation where players navigate through a hazardous mine to escape safely. The mine is filled with various cells such as lava, walls, keys, locked doors, and collectible items like gold. The player's movement is determined by a path-finding algorithm that respects certain movement rules and restrictions based on the types of cells encountered.

## Project Description

The project simulates a character's attempt to escape from a mine filled with obstacles and treasures. Each mine map is represented as a grid of cells with different properties. Players must navigate from the starting cell to the exit, avoiding lava and walls, collecting keys to open locked doors, and possibly collecting gold, although gold will melt if the player walks adjacent to lava.

## Features

- Graphical representation of the mine and dynamic visualization of the path-finding process.
- A variety of cell types including start, exit, floor, wall, lava, gold, key, and locked door cells.
- A recursive algorithm for navigating through the mine, utilizing a stack to backtrack when necessary.
- Collectible items like keys and gold, with the complication of gold melting near lava.
